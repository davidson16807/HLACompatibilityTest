# HLACompatibilityTest

This test measures dissimilarity in the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) region of the human genome. The HLA region comprises a set of genes that govern behavior in the human immune system. Studies suggest that traits within this region may influence a person's preference in romantic partner. A person's body odor, for instance, is perceived as more attractive when the HLA region of that person is genetically dissimilar. Couples who are dissimilar in this way have been shown to experience greater fidelity and romantic satisfaction. 

The attraction felt towards HLA-dissimilar individuals has the overall effect of increasing zygosity in the HLA region of offspring. There is no known preference to form more specific gene combinations. The "compatibility score" is based on this observation, which measures the expected zygosity score of offspring.
